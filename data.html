            <p>According to the article “What is Data Protection and Privacy?” by Cloudian, data protection is all about the strategies and procedures we put in place to safeguard the privacy, availability, and integrity of sensitive information. Often, people use the term 'data security' interchangeably with it. These protective measures are crucial for businesses that collect, manage, or store sensitive data, as they aim to prevent data corruption, loss, or damage. In today's world, where data collection and storage are skyrocketing, having a solid data protection strategy is more important than ever. The main goal of data protection isn't just to keep sensitive information safe; it's also about ensuring that it's accessible and reliable, which helps maintain trust and compliance in data-driven operations.

<br></br>Similarly, data privacy refers to a set of guidelines that dictate how we collect and manage data, considering its sensitivity and importance. Personal health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) are often protected under various data privacy laws. This encompasses things like financial details, medical records, social security or ID numbers, names, birth dates, and contact information. Concerns about data privacy extend to any sensitive information that a company deals with, including that of customers, shareholders, and employees. Often, this data is vital for a business's operations, growth, and financial health. Data privacy plays a crucial role in ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to those who are authorized to see it. It helps prevent criminals from misusing data and assists organizations in complying with regulatory requirements.</p>
